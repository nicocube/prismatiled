# Prismatiled

Some applications need a map system without the seriousness of a realistic spheric coordinate. But if you look for something consistent with physics, some project like OSM are your best choice.

Prismatiled is a highly simplificated mapping system essentially thought for games that need some map modelization without the hassle of real physics. World are modelized with a prismatic tiled map server, capable to grow from a local binded map to a big cylinder, connecting two border of a large map, and maybe other models in the future.
